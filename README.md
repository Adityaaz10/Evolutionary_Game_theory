# Evolutionary_Game_theory
Evolutionary Bee Swarm Simulation is a Python based project that models evolutionary game theory using agent-based simulations. The environment simulates a population of bees interacting with various pollen sources, where each bee adapts its foraging strategy to maximize rewards over generations. Implemented with Pygame for visualization, NumPy for efficient computation, and replicator dynamics for strategy evolution, this project demonstrates how agent preferences, fitness, and mutation produce natural selection and emergent optimal behaviors in a simulated ecosystem. The simulation provides statistical analysis, graphical outputs, and interactive controls to observe evolution in real-time
